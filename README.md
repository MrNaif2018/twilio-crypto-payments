# Pay for twilio services and use them(sms, voice, video, messenger) via cryptocurrencies

This project is built for [Dev.to & Twilio hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-twilio-hackathon-on-dev-2lh8).

It fits in category 3: integrating twilio APIs with other APIs(in my case, my own API and SDK - [bitcart](https://github.com/MrNaif2018/bitcart)).
